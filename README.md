# OSTSEEclient

- Especially alphabeta (Negamax), parser and network client arent my own work, thus covered by same license modell. 
Bent them to a non-Docker vcxproj to fit this project.
- Client works with common chess-program logics and functions like turngenerator, intern board representation, rating function, turn choice,etc.
