# OSTSEEclient

- Especially alphabeta (Negamax), parser and network client arent my own work, thus covered by same license modell. 
Bent them to a non-Docker vcxproj to fit this project
- Client works with common chess-program logics and functions like turngenerator, intern board representation, rating function, turn choice, etc.
- For more information about chess programming or if you look for a good start in your own chess programming then vist the fabulous Chess Programming Wiki (CPW) -> https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page
